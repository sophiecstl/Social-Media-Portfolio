What I learned from the social media class:

At the beginning I thought this course was about how to design beautiful social media posts and how to generate a lot of followers. When I realized that we were learning programming I was disappointed at first. But after a while I really enjoyed HTML, CSS and javascript. That's why I built my own website. It's not perfect yet, but I'll keep practicing a lot. It was also really fun to analyze social media networks. I was in the bereal group and I noticed things that I probably wouldn't have noticed at all.

Thank you.
